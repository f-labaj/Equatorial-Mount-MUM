 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.778   TIME= 23:35:20
 Too many nodes 5094 are included in the force-distributed-surface       
 constraint identified by real constant set 18.  This may greatly        
 affect solver performance due to large wave fronts and memory           
 consumption.  Also check results carefully and consider solving with a  
 different unit system.
